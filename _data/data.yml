    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      When people ask me about my profession, I always have to think twice, 
      because there is no clear answer. At the moment, 
      I am an Early Career Researcher in spatial statistics. 
      I have a background in Biology/Ecology (MSc) and a PhD in Environmental Sciences/Ecotoxicology.
      My main study system are streams and rivers. I am fascinated by their diversity and dynamics
      and how these influence the corresponding ecosystem. My current project is on spatial dependencies
      in stream networks. I am currently exploring my options from early 2020 so if you have freshwater data
      that longs for analysis or an exciting field project that requires an experienced aquatic ecologist, 
      please let me know!
